# 🌿 Landscapes with p5.js – Generative Textures for Natural Systems

Live site: [https://ldolanldolan.github.io/landscapes_p5js](https://ldolanldolan.github.io/landscapes_p5js)

This project explores the creation of **natural textures, patterns, and visual systems** using **generative JavaScript art** with [p5.js](https://p5js.org/). Inspired by environmental forms — rain, erosion, organic layering — each sketch harnesses **random numbers, visual algorithms, and evolving code structures** to mimic the look and feel of the natural world.

The sketches are designed to be used or adapted in contexts such as:

- 🌍 **Energy studies and visual simulations**
- 🌿 **Environmental design & sustainability education**
- 📊 **Scientific outreach or climate data visualisation**
- 🎨 **Generative art installations and ambient motion pieces**

**Current included systems:**
- `rain.js` – Abstracted rainfall and kinetic vertical lines
- `collage.js` – Fragmented visual layering with natural blocks
- `GenerativeSketchPad.js` – Freer-form exploratory sketching interface

## 🎯 Purpose & Research Intent

This project began as an investigation into how **randomness, noise, and visual probability** can simulate:
- Natural motion
- Texture gradients
- Organic layering

By exploring **how generative patterns can mimic natural forms**, the goal is to create a visual toolset that might support:
- **Environmental modelling**
- **Energy conservation research**
- **Green interface design**
- And **creative science communication**
